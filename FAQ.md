#### Q: What is this?
A: DasBlog-core  is an open source blogging engine based heavily on the  work produced by a community of volunteers and contributors who helped make [the original DasBlog a very popular blogging option](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog).


#### Q: Does this replace the original DasBlog?
A: We think so. The original DasBlog relies on Web Forms and is thus not supported in .NET Core.


#### Q: Does it work on a Mac?  On Linux?
A: Since .NET Core runs on Mac OS and Linux Das runs there also. Any original code that relied on Windows-specific APIs have been removed.


#### Q: I found a bug, what do I do?
A: Add to an existing issue or create a [new issue via GitHub](https://github.com/poppastring/dasblog-core/issues). Before creating a new issue, make sure that the issue does not already exist and feel free to add to the issue.


#### Q: How can I get involved?
A: Please jump right in!  We love contributions and we are happy to offer advice.


#### Q: Do DasBlog-Core  support themes?
A: Yes. Themes are developed using Razor! More details can be found [here](https://github.com/poppastring/dasblog-core/wiki/4.-Designing-a-theme).


#### Q: Is there a public Theme gallery?
A: Not currently, we might start with something simple like a wiki page; but if youâ€™re interested, this would be a great community contribution.


#### Q: How can I support this effort?
A: Here are a few ways you can support the Open Live Writer effort:
